The initializePlate function sets up the original plate, with the 25s being in the center

There are conditions that make the corners the averages of their 2 neighbors and to make the sides certain values and the center 25 degrees C The updateTemperature function makes 1 iteration to the plate put in the function (for this case, the initial plate), so it takes the averages of the middle squares and makes a new plate the same size and makes the value of that plate the average of the point on the originals 4 neighbor values, this will do it for every point, and the borders of the new plate will remain the same The analyzePlate function uses the mean and find functions to calculate the average temperature of the newest Plate and to find the index of maximum change of the newest plate by subtracting the original plate from the newest one.

To run the code, run all of the code in the main script using the run button, as the functions are all in it with the stuff needed for the loop, images, and video, this will make a 50x50 grid with a plot of the intiial plate, a video with 1142 iterations, a plot of the values on the diagonal and the index of the max change in temperature and the avergae temperature of the newest plate
